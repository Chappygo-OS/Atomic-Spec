# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution

<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]

<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->

[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]

<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->

[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]

<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->

[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]

<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->

[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]

<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->

[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

## [SECTION_2_NAME]

<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]

<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## [SECTION_3_NAME]

<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]

<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance

<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]

<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->

### Article X: The Assembly Line Manual

The **Assembly Line Manual** (located in `.specify/knowledge/stations/`) is the authoritative procedural guide for all implementation details.

1.  **Supremacy**: In any conflict between the Assembly Line Manual and this Constitution, you should pause and ask the user for clarification. The problem should be well-explained.
2.  **Mandatory Reference**: Before generating any artifact (Plan, Task list, or Code), you MUST read the specific Station file corresponding to that domain (e.g., read `06-api-contracts.md` before planning APIs).
3.  **Gatekeeper**: You may not mark a task as complete until the specific "Gate Criteria" defined in that Station are met.

**Version**: [CONSTITUTION_VERSION] | **Ratified**: [RATIFICATION_DATE] | **Last Amended**: [LAST_AMENDED_DATE]

<!-- Example: Version: 2.1.1 | Ratified: 2025-06-13 | Last Amended: 2025-07-16 -->
